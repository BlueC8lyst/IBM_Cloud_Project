# PMGSY Project Classification

### Project Overview

The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) Project Classification aims to build a machine learning model that automatically categorizes rural road and bridge construction projects into their corresponding PMGSY schemes (e.g., PMGSY-I, PMGSY-II, RCPLWEA). Leveraging physical and financial project features, our solution ensures scalable, accurate, and transparent classification to support infrastructure planning and policy evaluation.

### Key Components

- **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** Gather historical PMGSY project data, clean, handle missing values, and encode features.

- **Feature Engineering:** Select and transform impactful physical and financial attributes.

- **Model Development:** Train and tune an XGBoost Classifier on IBM Watson Studio AutoAI.

- **Evaluation:** Assess performance using Accuracy, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix.

- **Deployment:** Prepare the trained model for integration in a decision-support dashboard.

### Prerequisites

- IBM Cloud Account with Watson Studio access

- AutoAI capability enabled in Watson Studio

### Model Evaluation

- Accuracy: 0.92

- F1-Score: 0.89
